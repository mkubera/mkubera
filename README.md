### Hi there 👋

<!--
**mkubera/mkubera** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a coding mentor on a couple of bootcamps (Poland/remote)
- Always on the lookout for more interesting work (remote bootcamps, workshops, edu-tech, 1-2-1 mentoring)
- Supporting wanna-be coders who need a tiny bit of free mentoring on [codingcoach.io](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Nick+Kubera)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `["music composition", "lyrics writing", "Elm", "Lamdera", "☀shine"]`
- 👯 I’m *not* looking for collaborations at the moment.
- 💬 Ask me about `["functional programming", "niche music 😎", "open-source social media alternatives 🙏"]`
- ⚡ Fun fact: not a fan of lol-catz 😋
